# PackTrack Package Tracker Website
This website project was created during the Frontend Development module in Software Development Academy, iteration 9.

This website is hosted by Firebase, and can be visited at <a href="https://packtrack-sda-9.web.app">https://packtrack-sda-9.web.app</a>

## Project Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses components from Leaflet (see Credits).

### React: Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

 `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

 `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

 `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### React: Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
